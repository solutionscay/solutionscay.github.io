Hello, my name is **Jose**. I am an experienced IT professional who enjoys collaborating with others to solve complex problems. Since 2007, I have assisted executives and business owners in various industries by improving their operations with custom database and application development. Most recently, I have led technical teams of around 12 and 15 members with diverse backgrounds and skill sets.

### Experience

**_Oracle of America, Inc. - Principal Member of Technical Staff_**

_Jun 2021 - Present_

I developed SaaS applications using Oracle APEX for the Food & Beverage, Hospitality, and Local Government sectors. I utilized the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform and worked with various services, including Autonomous Database, Object Storage, Vault, Vision, Document Understanding, and Serverless Functions. I also developed and extended integrations with different payment providers. My role involved collaborating with business experts to gather information and translate it into actionable design and development plans. I wrote complex SQL queries to analyze data and integrate information from various sources, providing valuable insights. Additionally, I mentored junior developers and created technical documentation that outlines best practices.

_June 2021 - November 2021_

I developed a detailed long-range plan to modernize a custom tool for managing marketing campaigns.

**_Dallas ISD, Dallas - Manager Software Development_**

_March 2020 - July 2021_

I provided technical leadership, management, and mentoring for a team of Oracle APEX developers, SQL DBAs, and Power BI specialists. I led the development of custom applications for various departments within the district. Some of the solutions we created include a system for tracking the services provided by mental health clinicians, a system to monitor multiple aspects of student transportation services (including API integration with the buses' GPS systems), and a dashboard to track student engagement across various Ed-tech platforms. In approximately eight months, our team developed and deployed more than twenty Oracle APEX applications, serving an average of 400 unique users per day.

**_Dallas ISD, Dallas - Assistant Director_**

_March 2018 - March 2020_

I directed the operation and strategic planning of technology within the Food Services department. I managed a budget of $2.2 million for hardware, software, and various technology initiatives. I developed dashboards using Microsoft SQL Server and Tableau to monitor inventory levels and meal production in school cafeterias. Additionally, I established, maintained, and implemented policies and procedures for the help desk, change control, and application development. I also created solutions in Oracle APEX to manage food orders and deliveries to various locations during the summer programs.

**_Dallas ISD, Dallas - Executive Analyst_**

_November 2015  - March 2018_

I developed several FileMaker applications for the Food Services department. One of these applications helped the procurement team track inventory levels, school orders, reorder points, issuance history, shortages, product velocity, and expiration dates. Additionally, I created FileMaker systems to manage various meal programs, including after-school, summer school, Saturday school, and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program. I also developed in-house Android applications that integrate with FileMaker to facilitate inventory stock rotation, manage kitchen equipment work orders, and handle IT service tickets. Furthermore, I worked on various data integrations with Oracle data marts.

**_Dallas ISD, Dallas - Principal Analyst_**

_November 2014  - November 2015_

I consolidated seventy individual FileMaker databases into a single, integrated system. I developed a system for temporary employees to clock in and out, which includes modules for reconciling timesheets and billing statements from temp agencies. Additionally, I created a management system for the After-School and Saturday School meal programs. I also developed a procurement bidding system for food, small equipment, and large equipment. This system enables users to compile bid programs on a USB drive, allowing vendors to submit their bids electronically. Furthermore, I implemented an FMGo system for iPad to facilitate physical inventories in the warehouse using barcode scanning.
